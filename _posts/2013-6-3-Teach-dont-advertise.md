When you think about it, our culture has definitely shifted into a chaotic structure that on a logical level just doesn't work. It’s just considered normal by the standards of the “industry” to co-create a workaholic environment by praising everyone who can sacrifice his own life for work, measuring quantity not quality… measuring time spent in the office and not time doing actual work.

But we are always living in a transition, most of the companies right now have fewer employees than a coffee shop, and a lot of them are still starting.

Always starting, and not entrepreneuring, so it’s only loyal to them to call them Starters. Entrepreneur has really too much weight on it. Sure it looks great to impress someone, but why should you impress someone by the amount of mistakes you already made in your first business, tell them that you are starting out.

And by starting, start at the epicenter... Don't just build your product, make a dent in the universe with it, change people lives with it.

But to change someone else, the change must start within, solve your own problem, you never quite realize how many there are sharing your own problems, and don't try to guess, don't make plans for it, just make something...when the inspiration is burning within you, don't stop...

No Time is No Excuse, if you look at it that way, you just don't want it bad enough.
But if you are willing to start, start at the epicenter. And no excuses about that special tool that you need to unlock your creativity, the tone is in your fingers not in your tools.

On being a hero, an overnight success, it takes time, and if you are racing against yourself, about some simple project, don't worry… every night full of work, is one less day for the same work, so let your idea flow, it takes time, everything takes time, even if you've got a major delivery coming up, just outreach to your superior, and talk to him, simply explain why it’s taking so much,quick communication is also the key.

And when you think you're done with your project, use this:

Don't advertise, teach.
By the end, this is what I retained from the amazing Rework, so simple, yet so precise, if you have time to pick it up, or just get the audiobook please teach someone about what you have learned from it.
