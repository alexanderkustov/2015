At Inspiring we have this way to contribute into the tech startup world with a little process we call Shared-Risk Development. It’s absolutely the same as any type of development and consulting with all the design services included, but the only difference is that we don't take money from the start, but only participate in the success of your idea.

We enjoy working with founders who are still in a very early phase of their businesses, since seeking developers or designers who will join them in that phase and work with a risk for a maybe future reward or no reward at all, is always an issue, we try to help them out.

So let’s give those founders and their businesses a fighting chance, let those ideas exist, who knows what you can create given the proper technology.

Since this sounds too good to be true, we take the necessary time to explain to everyone that tech startups don't rely solely on tech, and even having a huge platform and the greatest app you, the founder/ceo/promoter, still need to be the main driver for it, and if you're not promoting it, acquiring customers or doing something to convert besides waiting for us to finish the platform for you, your startup is going to be another one of those that no one have ever heard about.

Right now you may think, do these guys build complete web applications for free? How long does it take you? I've heard of this web thing that took about two years to build, how can you survive for two years?
First of all, it’s not free, its the same way as an investor makes his money, small bets here and there, a lot of confidence in the industry and a tiny part of luck. Secondly, we will not make it past the minimum viable product, the moment you can validate it, start getting customers, selling or achieving your goals, that is where our work ends and your work begins, but let us explain more clearly about it all.

1.Start by explaining the main purpose of your idea and please tell a good story.
If you don’t know how to explain your business, you don't have a business, if you are not great at sharing your motivation, few will follow your idea, try to address the main issue for those who need it most to be solved, if we can sense that it is in fact an opportunity, we will support you.

2.Understand clearly where is the minimum viability, and where is superfluous features and growth hacking techniques from about a dozen of different apps.
Everyone knows that a lot of apps, have tried being everything and then started shrinking into one feature therefore taking best shape, if you can get into that mood from the start you will have faster results, we will greatly appreciate your simplicity and you might have a greater chance of success.

Try clearly stating that the main point of your platform, for example: Crowdfunding local schools platform, in terms of web development will need a crowdfunding mechanism and a local school list, that’s it. If you are trying to build a huge CRM app for schools to be able to manage their needs for every department and every student, and having a crowdfunding possibility somewhere in between professors and parents you are going too far, it will take quite a while to understand if you can address the needs of everyone in those terms, and to explain it all to please everyone, so please read along the lines about simple is better, simple is beautiful, simple is minimum viability.

3.Be ready to prototype, mockup, design and envision everything from the start, even if you are not good at it.
You may think, I don't know anything about web platforms or mobile applications, we never ask you to do that on your own, we just want to see your vision in it’s clearest visible form, sketch with your pencil, or create simple mockups with all those free apps around. Check out the Siri co-founder Adam Cheyer, he had a vision and a drawing of having his app alongside all of the others greatest in the physical Apple store, look how it turned out. Just having a clear visible goal, is already half the way for anyone to understand what are you building and how you are going to get it done.

4.Start generating business before anything is built.
If you have a free-landing page explaining your concept, go and capture leads, if you can accept subscriptions from people who believe in you before you have anything, or just raise enough interest from your market, you are already way ahead.

Every app/platform takes quite a while to be done, and losing the momentum can be quite hard for innovative ideas, it will make everyone look tired in the process. So please don't wait, just keep doing what you will do the moment that it’s finished, make new contacts, explain your service, and keep in touch with them.

5.Have a clear mind that we are investing in you, we are risking time and resources, so don't give up easily.
As investors see your financials, we try to understand those as well, we try to see how well you are going to perform in a year or two having your idea built, so if you are envisioning profits from the third month, so are we envisioning that shared success, if it takes more than that, we are still here to understand what went wrong and maybe switch the main focus/design to accommodate that turn, try to be optimistic about it.

6.If it fails, if your idea isn't viable, we are still your friends for the next one.
Of course we have spent time together in building something, maybe it didn't perform that well, and the return level was maybe insufficient for it to call a success, learn to move on, we already learned that, your idea will remain yours, the only thing we keep on our side is what we made, so the code will remain as our property as the design assets.

7.If it succeeds, let’s continue?
If you followed the steps from 1 to 5, I think you may have already a great path to success laid out, so your app reaches the potential market and get’s you enough to make it a business, if you clearly see that the MVP was validated and you know the next logical step, adding this or that feature, we are here to assist you in that, we love to see startups grow, we set our maintenance fees at your business level, and we can now grow together even further.

In no way I intended to write this as a mere publicity , since this doesn’t at all applies to us, but teaches you to apply this to your business. If you are ready on those steps towards your idea, you can approach any developer with a huge boost on your side or just outsource it easily having those points in your favour and not having to explore with the developers or designers of your next big thing.

But if you have something creative on your mind and you're still looking for a developer to build it, why not have a chat with us? How about a fine tea or a cup of coffee? Just tweet me your idea, I'll definitely take a look at it.
